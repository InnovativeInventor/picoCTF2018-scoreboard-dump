# picoCTF 2018 scoreboard dump

I  used `dump.py` to dump the scoreboard. This is meant to provide a snapshot of competition if someone is curious in the future. I do not take responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of the data. Use it as your own risk.

You cannot run `dump.py` directly. You need to add your login credentials first to the `cookies` variable.

The txt file is meant to be read by a human while the tsv file by a computer. The data inside is identical. It's only the format that's different.
